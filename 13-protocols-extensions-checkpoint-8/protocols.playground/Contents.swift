/*
 How to create and use protocols
 - Protocols are a bit like contracts in Swift: they let us define what kinds of functionality we expect a data type to support, and Swift ensures that the rest of our code follows those rules.
 - a "protocol" is another type
 - Protocol defines a series of properties and methods that we want to use. They don’t implement those properties and methods – they don’t put any code behind it – they just say that the properties and methods must exist, a bit like a blueprint.
 - no function bodies allowed in a protocol
