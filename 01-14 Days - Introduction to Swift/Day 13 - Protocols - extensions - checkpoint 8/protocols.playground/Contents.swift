/*
 How to create and use protocols
 - they let us define what kinds of functionality we expect a data type to support
 - they don't provide the actual functionality
 - a protocol needs to specify a list of bare requirements
 - a protocol is a new type
 - no function bodies allowed in the protocol
 - you can conform to as many protocols as you want
