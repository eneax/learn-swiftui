/*
 Structs
 - helps you create complex data types
 = variables and constants that belong to structs are called "properties"
 - functions that belong to structs are called "methods"
 - when you create a constant or variable out of a struct, you call that an instance â€“ you might create a dozen unique instances of the Album struct, for example
 - when you create instances of structs you do so using an initializer like this: Album(title: "Wings", artist: "BTS", year: 2016).
