 How to copy classes
 - classes are "reference types" in Swift
 - all copies of a class instance share the same data
 - any changes you make to one copy will automatically change the other copies
 - it allows you to share common data across all parts of our app
 - structs are "value types" and do not share their data amongst copies

    var username = "Anonymous"
}

var user1 = User()
var user2 = user1

print(user1.username) // Taylor
print(user2.username) // Taylor


/*
 Deep Copy
 - it creates a unique copy of a class instance
 - future changes wonâ€™t impact the original data
